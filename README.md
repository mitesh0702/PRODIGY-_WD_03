The Tic Tac Toe Web Application is a simple, interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

This project demonstrates core front-end development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation. The application includes visual feedback for wins and draws, and can be easily extended with features like AI opponent or score tracking.

It is lightweight, responsive, and runs entirely in the browser without the need for any backend services.
